### Hammer

The hammer art started out as a literal hammer.

Eventually, I went away from these designs entirely and did something completely original. I really like the result.

### Environment

None of the environments here actually made it into the game... I wanted to but ran out of time.

### Enemies


#### Ranged Medium

There is no ranged medium mech, but if there was I would have made it look like this!

#### Lancer Medium

There is no lancer medium mech.

	I like the idea of a mech that charges in a straight line with a wind-up.

#### Sword Medium

This is the default enemy mech in the game. I took pretty major inspiration from Warhammer, but quickly mixed it with a few other things.

All-in-all, I don't think the final result looks anything like warhammer.

	Good base design. I think this is my "base" (Scroll down, the warhammer guy with a knife)

#### Boss Ideas

I did not end up using this but really liked the concept.

	I love the drill animation. would make a fun mech with enough wind up to get Max out of the way.
