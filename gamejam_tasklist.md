## POST JAM THOUGHTS

Emily Playtest:
* Did not know why you couldnâ€™t pick up a wrench in max. Should have a blurb about that.
* Squirrel hit box for picking up wrench is small. Should make it about 25% bigger to account for how fast he is.
* She did not get the turret controls. Not sure how to fix that.
* Emily frantically looked for a wrench in a level. Need to have a free wrench easily available in every level
* Emily id not understand why you can only hold one wrench. Consider allowing you to stack them and add a UI if you are at your limit

Random feedback from itch:
* Should have a button to eject from max and repilot so you don't have to click. Clicking is awkward.
* Movement felt terrible in MAX

My personal thoughts:
* Shadows under enemies don't work
* Level design looks like butts and needs an overhaul.
* SO much tech debt that bothers me.

MARKETING
* The gifs text is too small
* The gifs are grainy
* The gifs take too long to setup and use and export as a video

One week later me bad/improvement thoughts:

* [Sound] Sound effect on junkyard king lacks "punch"
* [Sound] Swiper attack is wrong. It feels like a dagger instead of something crunchy.

* [Pixel Art] Shadows on the mechs still look terrible
* [Pixel Art] Feet movement on max looks bad
* [Pixel Art] SWIPER mech feet "air" animation looks like its crying.

* [Level Design] World space looks flat and uninviting
* [Level Design] Mech bay starting area looks trash
* [Level Design] Shipping containers don't look good.
* [Level Design] Tutorial text in the world feels out of place and literally placed in. Because it is.
* [Level Design] Junkyard Gate looks bad.
* [Level Design] Tutorial text is bad and repeats "Repair him"

* [Visuals] No animation for repairing, boarding, or ejecting from max feels bad
* [Visuals] Z-index fighting. Freek/Max should always be on top.
* [Visuals] Squirrel movement sounds don't sound good.

* [Gameplay] MAX movement feels hollow. No sounds. Looks bad. Feels bad.
* [Gameplay] Going straight into the world from a button with no short cutscene feels... not great?
* [Gameplay] Max becoming inoperatonal feels random and uneventful.
* [Gameplay] Max hammer needs to reach just a little farther
* [Gameplay] Max hammer should be "bankable" and not cooldown immediately. Letting the player "revv up" the hammer
* [Gameplay] Junkyard King feels random. Like, suddenly you see this big mech? it lacks "oomf"

* [Art Direction] there is not a cohesive "shadow" being cast anywhere which makes the game look bad.

* [GUI] The health bar looks terrible
* [GUI] Repair wrench icon looks bad, out of place, and is unintuitive

* [Project] No icon

* [Bug]: Animation connections in the state tree will replay and error out
* [Bug]: At least on macos, Godot4 has a weird audio popping sound
* [Bug] State system does not work well with scenetree events. Interrupting is bad. A timer/other delayed execution will still fire.

* [Marketing] cut screenshots in gif form look bad.

EMILY NOTES:

* Repair wrench does not perfectly insinuate "Heal Max" visually
* Max icon is not obvious its supposed to be a camera

IAN THOUGHTS:

* "Was it supposed to end by killing that one random mech?"
