# Theme Ideas

"Built To Scale"

Things I like:

* mixing and matching scale definitely seems like a really good ticket
* Start as {big thing} and progressively become {small thing}
* Swap out components of yourself
* Kardashev Scale
* Problem solving on one scale directly problem solves on another scale.

## Active Ideas

### Automation Farm Game

	COMPLEXITY- EASY
	ASSET - MEDIUM
	UI - MEDIUM

attempt to scale your farm, where everything continues to scale up and produce more and more. Automation. Basically SDV but incredibly bite sized scoped to planting, harvesting, and automating collection for "number go up"

	Plant plants
	Water plants
	Harvest plants
		(if you don't harvest fast enough, they die)
	Sell
	Build automated machines that:
		Fertilize
		Plant
		Water
		Harvest
		Sell
	Buy another farm (repeat)


	RULES OF THREE
	1. Do everything yourself
	2. Hire robots
	3. Take over the landscape

Why do I like this? Becauze it seems like a game I would find fun in a game jam. It doesn't seem _hard_. And plants are fun.

### Arena Fighter (Russian Doll Robot Game)

	COMPLEXITY- MODERATE
	ASSET - HEAVY
	UI - LOW

* Arena Fighter (You are 3 robots that stack into each other. Each with different capabilities.)

Why do I like this?
* Multiple "Scales" of combat
* Still directly feed back into each other
* Can promote hectic gameplay
* Seems simple to understand

Problems:
* Three robots feeling like different "Scales" is hard to pull off. 





## Discard Ideas


* Scale // Climb things
* Platformer to increase/decrease in size (no platforming xp)
* Jack and the giant beanstalk (assend higher and higher and "Scale Up" the beanstalk)
* Musical Scale (build a song) (no musical talent)
* Bombing game unlocking more powerful munitions (I don't want to build a game about bombing people)
* RTS/FPS hybrid (too big.)
* Storm builder (you advance as the storm withdraws, and recede when the storm advances)
* Space Game (Start as a fighter and defeat opponents, unlocking their abilities and getting "bigger". Fighter to Frigate to Destroyer to Dreadnaught to Battleship to Death Star)

### Incremental Game (Management Simulation // Kardashev Game)

	COMPLEXITY- EASY
	ASSET - LOW -> HIGH
	UI - HEAVY

Management Simulation (You are a fleet logistics company. Start by booking logistics capacity on other peoples ships. Then buy your own. Then ugprade them. Repeat. Take over the crown.)

	Complexity is dependent. Do you literally build solar panels or just build a menu+button for it? Are you a character, or a being with a camera?

	Start by building a single solar panel.
	Then build solar farms
	Then build space based solar
	Then build a dyson swarm
	Then send von neumann probes
	Then build a dyson sphere and more dyson swarms
	Eventually build a black hole bomb


	Balance energy use
		Recreation
		Mining
		Building

	RULE OF THREES:

	1. Planet
	2. Solar System
	3. Galaxy

### Schmup Space Game (Level Up with Components from your fallen enemies, BECOME the Death Star)

	COMPLEXITY- MODERATE
	ASSET - HEAVY
	UI - MEDIUM

(Start as a fighter and defeat opponents, unlocking components you can swap in and out)

Why do I like this? Because I want to build a game like House of the Dying Sun. Probably the least well thought out. The "Built to Scale" seems like it would be challenging to pull off.

I like the idea of "upgrading" your ship to fight bigger badder enemies. But like, that's kindof it? And building a HotDS type of game seems like it _needs_ to be in 3d to get the proper effect.


### Exploration Boat Game

	COMPLEXITY- HIGH
	ASSET - HEAVY
	UI - HIGH

(Start as a {big boat} working towards a goal. Eventually you need to get into {small boat}. Time trials and collision play a major role)

Why do I like this?
* no combat / fighting
* 

problems:
* "scale" piece has same problem as arena fighter
* no obvious "hook"
* middle between an arena fighter and the vehicle game

### Vehicle Game

	COMPLEXITY- HIGH
	ASSET - HEAVY
	UI - HIGH

You are a pilot in a vehicle. Control it by being inside of the vehicle and seeing what it says. Capture part upgrades and install them. Repair damaged interior components.

	Seems too complicated.

	You control the Captain.
	You can move around the control room.
	You can go up to stations to move the craft.
	You can open up your nav to see where you are and where you are going.
	You can leave the ship to go explore when it is landed and collect / install supplies.

	Some form of ground combat with the captain.
	Some form of space combat with the ship. Navigation Challenges.

Why do I like this?
* Because you operate on two different "Scales" that feedback into each other. Problem solving on one directly problem solves on another.

Problems:
* Really fucking complicated
* Difficult to explain and teach
* Difficult to "Scale" the challenge appropriately
* Difficult in explaining what the "Goal" is (What is the goal?)
